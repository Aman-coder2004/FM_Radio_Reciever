📻 FM Receiver Using TDA7000 IC

A compact and low-cost FM Receiver capable of receiving 88–108 MHz radio signals using the TDA7000 FM Receiver IC and LM386 Audio Amplifier.

📌 Project Description

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an FM Receiver using the TDA7000 IC. The receiver captures FM broadcast signals, selects the desired station using an LC tuning network, demodulates the FM signal, amplifies the recovered audio using the LM386 amplifier, and outputs sound through a speaker.

The project was designed and simulated using Proteus and focuses on understanding RF amplification, FM demodulation, tuning circuits, and audio amplification.
